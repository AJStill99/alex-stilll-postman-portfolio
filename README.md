Postman project for API testing, which aids in my overal portfolio for QA Engineering

# Postman Portfolio

This repository contains an API testing project created using Postman.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core QA skills when testing APIs, including:
- Sending HTTP requests
- Validating response status codes
- Verifying response bodies
- Testing both positive and negative scenarios

This project focuses on clarity and QA thinking rather than advanced automation or complex scripting.

## API Under Test

The public test API provided by https://reqres.in is used for this project.

It allows safe testing of common user-related endpoints such as:
- Retrieving users
- Creating users
- Handling error responses

## Tools Used

- Postman
- Reqres public API
- GitHub

## Scope

The project includes:
- Basic GET and POST requests
- Simple automated checks using Postman tests
- Intentional negative test cases

## Notes

This is a learning-focused project and may be extended over time as API testing skills improve.

JSONPlaceholder always returns 201 on POST requests, even for invalid data.
This illustrates how negative tests may behave differently depending on the API.
